## 🗂️ Folder Structure

Each member has a **pre-created personal folder** inside the `Homework` directory. Use your folder for all your homework submissions.

```
Homework/
└── Your-Name/
    ├── Homework-1/
    │   └── solution.py
    ├── Homework-2/
    │   └── solution.py
    └── ...
```

🔸 Organize your submissions by creating a subfolder inside your name folder for each homework (e.g., `Homework-1`, `Homework-2`, etc.).  
🔸 Place all relevant files inside the corresponding homework subfolder.
